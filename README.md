POS TAGGING Implementation:
Tagging is a kind of classification that may be defined as the automatic assignment of description to the tokens. Here the descriptor is called tag, which may represent one of the part-of-speech, semantic information and so on.
Part-of-Speech (PoS) tagging can be defined as the process of assigning one of the parts of speech to the given word.
In simple words, we can say that POS tagging is a task of labelling each word in a sentence with its appropriate part of speech.
