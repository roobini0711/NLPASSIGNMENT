Assignment to implement pos tagging of given content stored in a Text Files and represent them in the form of n-grams!

Introduction:

POS TAGGING Implementation:
Tagging is a kind of classification that may be defined as the automatic assignment of description to the tokens. Here the descriptor is called tag, which may represent one of the part-of-speech, semantic information and so on.
Part-of-Speech (PoS) tagging can be defined as the process of assigning one of the parts of speech to the given word.
In simple words, we can say that POS tagging is a task of labelling each word in a sentence with its appropriate part of speech.

Methodology:

Natural Language Processing with Python provides a practical introduction to programming for language processing. Written by the creators of NLTK, it guides the reader through the fundamentals of writing Python programs, working with corpora, categorizing text, analyzing linguistic structure, and more. The online version of the book has been been updated for Python 3 and NLTK 3. 
Tokens are the individual words and tokenization is taking word or group of words and breaking it into individual words. For Example — If the given sentence is “NLP is easy to understand”, NLP, is, easy, to, understand are tokens here and breaking the given sentence in tokens is tokenization.
POS tagging, Word-Category disambiguation is the process of marking up a word in a text.
Chunking is a process of extracting phrases from unstructured text. Instead of just simple tokens which may not represent the actual meaning of the text, its advisable to use phrases such as “South Africa” as a single word instead of ‘South’ and ‘Africa’ separate words.

Conclusion:

Hence, A POS tag (or part-of-speech tag) is a special label assigned to each token (word) in a text corpus to indicate the part of speech and often also other grammatical categories such as tense, number (plural/singular), case etc.
POS tagging technique simplifies the classification process of words in a sentence and eases the analysis process. 
POS Tagging is also essential for building lemmatizers which are used to reduce a word to its root form.
